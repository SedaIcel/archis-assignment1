        <h1>Best of Lo-Fi Spotify Playlist</h1>   
        <p style="word-break: break-word;">Although the term lofi comes from 'low fidelity',
        meaning lower quality or stripped-back production, 
        lofi music is a mix of several different genres including hip hop, jazz and dream pop.
        These distinct styles come together to give lofi tracks a cool, relaxed 
        vibe that YouTube creators simply can't get enough of.</p>
